changes:
  - code_imp: Changed ordnance's area definition a bit, this includes the misc labs
      (usually used for circuit labs). Gameplay wise they will have new names.
  - code_imp: Made the ordnance chamber injector start off. You gotta turn them on
      using the monitors. Also tidied their code a bit.
