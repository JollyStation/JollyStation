  - balance: Super pacman no longer exists, the circuit board now switches between
      a low production - low consumption mode to high production - high consumption
      mode and viceversa
  - balance: This new mode has a max held sheet of 5, power generation changed from
      30-120kW (t1) and 120-480kW (t4) to 15-60 kW and consumes sheets ~3 times faster
