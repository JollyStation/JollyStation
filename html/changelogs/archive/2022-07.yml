  - bugfix: blacklists placeholder food items in the random food generator which caused
      error sprites appearing
  JollyStationBot:
  - bugfix: The agent card now correctly allows you to take anyone's identity, even
      if their name contains numbers

  '@Salex08':
  - admin: Admins can now cancel midround random events
  - bugfix: you start with the right amount of breathing mask again
  Guillaume Prata:
  - imageadd: New mime Hugbox!
  JollyStationBot:
  - bugfix: Chainsaws can now actually cut wood! So can the giant axe that is the
      PKC, and other chainsaw items - but, alas, esword handles alone can not, and
      you must actually turn them on. Also, all mining implements can mine scattered
      stones as well!
  - bugfix: Chainsaws are now faster when they are on, and slower when they aren't.
  - admin: Admins get another additional preference where Suppress All Ghost Roles
      only works while they are currently in an adminned state. They will still get
      ghost rolls normally when they are in a deadminned state.
  - bugfix: Limb growing code now uses species_color instead of mutant_color for synthetic
      limb coloration
  - code_imp: Refactored a large number of TGUI interfaces into TypeScript. If something's
      broken, report it!
  - rscadd: Furry Pride large spraypaint added to spraycans
  - bugfix: fixed crystalizer passing any item as the user and causing a runtime
  - bugfix: fixed telekinesis teleporting gun shenanigan
  - imageadd: Improves the sprites for bullets, thermal projectiles, and introduces
      pellet sprites.
  Melbert:
  - rscadd: The Mjolnir wizard loadout no longer scams you. It now also grants 1 level
      of Tesla Blast!
  - bugfix: Spells show up in the stat panel again
  - bugfix: Fixes runtime errors that can occur if a wizard spellbook randomizes into
      unpurchasable spells.
  - bugfix: Genetics powers now have their own background, which apparently they have
      always meant to have.
  - bugfix: Fixes some cases where chaplains are unable to cast their own spells.
  - bugfix: Fixes some granters being infinite when they should've been limited (Maint
      loot books).
  - bugfix: Wizard's roundend report is now more accurate in what spells they purchased.
  - balance: The mindswap book now gives a slight message warning it's changed on
      read.
  - balance: Sacred Flame now lets people around them know they're actually being
      made super flammable.
  - balance: Olfaction can't be cast if you have no nose (you're headless).
  - balance: Being Emotemute now prevents you from invoking spells which require emotes
      (mime spells).
  - balance: All wizard spells except Mindswap can't be cast if the wizard is just
      a brain. Most spells didn't work, anyways.
  - balance: PAIs and carded AIs can no longer cast spells. Most spells didn't work,
      anyways.
  - balance: You can't mindswap into PAIs and brains(?).
  - admin: Admins can now add spells by name or typepath.
  - admin: Spell requirements are bitflags now, so you can modify them with the bit-field
      VV ui. Pretty neat.
  - code_imp: proc_holders have been removed from existence.
  - refactor: Wizard, Heretic, Revenant, and Genetics spells are now all action datums.
  - refactor: Xenomorph, Spider, and Cytology monster abilities are now all action
      datums.
  - refactor: Some malf AI and cult abilities are now fully action datums instead
      of an unholy mix of proc holder and action.
  - refactor: Refactored how cult's blood target is set.
  - refactor: Bloodcrawling and jaunting have been completely refactored. Blood crawling
      has been exorcised from the living level of mobs, and the consumption part of
      (s)laughter demons is now handled by the action itself.
  - refactor: The wizard's teleport scroll now actually holds and casts a version
      of the "teleport" spell, instead of fake casting it.
  - refactor: Refactored the wizard spellbook a bit.
  - refactor: Refactored how all item actions are applied and handled.
  - rscdel: SDQL spells have been removed.
  Meyhazah:
  - imageadd: new sprites for the Chaplain's crusader, ancient, profane and follower
      outfits.
