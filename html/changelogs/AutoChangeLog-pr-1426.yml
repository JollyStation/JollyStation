changes:
  - bugfix: Chainsaws can now actually cut wood! So can the giant axe that is the
      PKC, and other chainsaw items - but, alas, esword handles alone can not, and
      you must actually turn them on. Also, all mining implements can mine scattered
      stones as well!
  - bugfix: Chainsaws are now faster when they are on, and slower when they aren't.
