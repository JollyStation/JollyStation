  - rscadd: adds the supermatter cascade round-ender, it can be triggered when the
      SM chamber is filled with hypernoblium and antinoblium at over 40% each, when
      the total moles are high enough to trigger a singulo and only when the SM integrity
      is over 80% (if the gases don't reach the requirement during the delamination
      for a moment, the whole thing will stop and need to restart)
