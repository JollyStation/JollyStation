changes:
  - balance: Changes supermatter powerloss function. It will transition to linear
      powerloss function at 5.88076GeV, and the linear powerloss function has been
      offset so that the transition between the two functions is completely smooth.
  - balance: Changes powerloss inhibition (both CO2 and psychologist effect) to change
      the rate of powerloss instead of changing the rate of both functions then comparing
      them to which one should be used.
