changes: 
  - refactor: "cryotubes can now work with any gases"
  - expansion: "cryotubes patients will actually breathe the air inside the tube and will respond to the gas accordingly (they'll suffer from breath loss if not in proper atmosphere inside the tube)"
  - expansion: "cryoxadone heals only if the patient is alseep, making the use of the anesthetic no longer just fluff but also functional"
  - qol: "replaced oxygen canisters with anesthetic ones (a mix of oxygen and n2o at 65-35 ratio) for allowing the patient to sleep"
