  - bugfix: "Nanotrasen realized that Kilo's Arrivals had a horrendous glitch... the lights and cameras weren't hooked up to anything. How saddening. It's been fixed now."
  - bugfix: "Also, Nanotrasen realized they spilled some dark juice (trademark) on some other lattices in that area so they cleaned up after themselves as well. How responsible!"
