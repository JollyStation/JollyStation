changes:
  - bugfix: Parallax will no longer "freeze" when you cross some area boundaries.
      Looks better now.
  - bugfix: Dragging objects diagonally will no longer cause them to visually "jump"
      to catch up to you. Seriously how did none report this, are we just collectively
      blind?
